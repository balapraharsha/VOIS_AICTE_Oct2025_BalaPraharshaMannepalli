# 📊 Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis – VOIS Internship

This project provides a detailed analysis of Airbnb booking data to uncover insights into property types, pricing strategies, host behavior, and guest satisfaction. It focuses on patterns in listings, reviews, availability, and service fees to help hosts optimize their listings and enhance the overall guest experience.

This project is part of an internship program brought to you by Edunet Foundation, leveraging VOIS and Vodafone Idea Foundation’s VOIS for Tech Program on Conversational Data Analytics with LLMs. As an intern, I gained hands-on experience analyzing real-world datasets and developed skills to enhance employability and confidence in data analytics.
